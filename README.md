### Lab 1
Lab 1 can befound in the /Lab1 directory. Outside of the included code, also found in that directory is a screen shot of the tests that pass after altering the original code given in the assignment handout (Tests_Passed.png).


### Lab 2
Lab 2 can befound in the /Lab2 directory. Outside of the included code, also found in that directory is a screen shot of the tests that pass after altering the original code given in the assignment handout (Tests_Passed.png).


### Lab 3
Lab 3 can befound in the /Lab3 directory. Outside of the included code, also found in that directory is a screen shot of the tests that pass after altering the original code given in the assignment handout (Tests_Passed.png).

As far as the required exercises the gates were constructed in QUIRK and then just translated into Q#. The challenges ( I only did 1 and 2) took some guess and check work, firstly to determinet that Ry was the required operation and then some messing around in quirk/referencing the block sphere it generates to determine the amount to shift. This is somewhat captured in the comments but took a substantial amount of time to determine.

I began to normalize the valeus in challenge 3 but couldn't find a pattern that seemed feasible to represent the encoded sine values through normal gate operations. Could've hardcoded with rotations but that felt like the wrong way to go.

### Lab 4 
Lab 4 can befound in the /Lab4 directory. Outside of the included code, also found in that directory is a screen shot of the tests that pass after altering the original code given in the assignment handout (Tests_Passed.png).

### Lab 6
Lab 4 can befound in the /Lab6 directory. Outside of the included code, also found in that directory is a screen shot of the tests that pass after altering the original code given in the assignment handout (Tests_Passed.png).

Passed challenge problem 1, did not find solution to challenge problem 2 but did attempt the problem.
